# 18 NoSQL: Social Network API

## Task

The challenge for this week was to build an API for social network web application where users can share thoughts and reactions and have a friends list. There was no starter code. 

Technologies used: Express.js for routing, MondoDB for database and the Mongoose ODM.

No seed data was provided, so data were created using Insomnia after the API was created. A walk-through video is shown later in this document. 

## Given User Story

```md
AS A social media startup
I WANT an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database
SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data
```

## Mock Up

The following video shows the functionality of various routes of the API.
